              Teaching English as a second language to Japanese students aged 6–80 of varying levels.
              <br> I tailored my lessons to suit each individual student, ensuring a professional delivery of the target material,
              while also engaging them on a personal level.
              <br>This job required excellent communication skills so that I could clearly explain various aspects of the lesson 
              in a way the student would understand and feel confident using themselves in future discussions, both inside and outside the classroom.

              Working in the warehouse of a company that provides equipment for live events,
              I showed a keen interest in learning, which enabled me to assist every department within the warehouse

              <br>This job was very demanding, requiring me to prepare large lists of equipment in a timely and efficient manner.

              This volunteering role involved visiting the wards of the hospital, speaking to patients and collecting song requests 
              to later play on the hospital radio. These conversations helped me learn more about the patients, allowing me to mention 
              something specific to them while on the air.
