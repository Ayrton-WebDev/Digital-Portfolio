    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Since returning to the UK after two years working in Japan, I have focused on reskilling by developing dynamic websites using a range of tools and technologies, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>EJS</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>APIs</li>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Web3 development</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I have a solid foundation in User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, developed during my university studies and enhanced through ongoing ICT coursework. I’ve worked with wireframing, usability principles, and design justification to ensure intuitive and accessible user experiences.
</p>

<p>
  I’m experienced with Git and GitHub for version control and team collaboration. My work with PostgreSQL includes designing structured, multi-table databases for systems such as school management platforms, focusing on efficient data organisation and retrieval.
</p>

<p>
  I approach problem-solving with a methodical mindset, taking time to understand the root cause of issues, assess potential impacts, break down challenges, and test solutions thoroughly. I thrive both independently and in collaborative environments.
</p>

<p>
  Quick to learn and highly adaptable, I’m eager to apply my technical and analytical skills in a professional IT setting.
