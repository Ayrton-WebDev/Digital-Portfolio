    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>Since returning to the UK after working in Japan for two years, I have re-skilled by focussing my personal development on; building dynamic websites using various tools and sources to enhance functionality, working on projects using: </p>
     
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>EJS</li>
        <li>node.js</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>API's</li>
        <li>react.js</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>web3 development</li>
        </ul>

      <p>I also have a strong foundation in User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, developed during my university coursework and expanded in my current ICT studies. 
      </p>I have worked with wireframing, usability principles, and design justification, ensuring intuitive and accessible user experiences.
      <p>Additionally, I have experience with Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration. My knowledge of PostgreSQL has involved designing structured databases, 
      such as school systems requiring multi-table management and efficient data retrieval.
      I am a proactive problem-solver who thrives in both independent and team environments, taking a systematic approach to troubleshooting, by fully understanding issues and consequences, 
      breaking down challenges into manageable tasks and testing solutions methodically.</p> 
      <p>My ability to learn quickly and adapt makes me eager to apply my technical and analytical skills in a professional IT setting.
